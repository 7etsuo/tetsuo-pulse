  "error": "Issue scope too large for single implementation",
  "details": "Issue #1418 is a CRITICAL security audit report documenting that the QUIC handshake module (src/quic/SocketQUICHandshake.c) contains incomplete TLS/crypto implementations. The issue identifies 5 major missing implementations:\n\n1. TLS Context Initialization (lines 272-280)\n2. Initial Packet Generation (lines 310-325)\n3. TLS Data Feed (lines 360-363)\n4. Key Derivation per RFC 9001 (lines 378-390)\n5. TLS State Machine Advancement (lines 400-408)\n\nThis is NOT a single implementable feature but rather a comprehensive audit report. Implementing production-ready TLS 1.3 integration for QUIC requires:\n\n- Full OpenSSL QUIC API integration (SSL_CTX, SSL objects, callbacks)\n- RFC 9001 compliant HKDF-Expand-Label key derivation\n- Initial secret derivation from Destination Connection ID\n- TLS 1.3 state machine management with CRYPTO frame handling\n- Transport parameter encoding/decoding in TLS extension\n- Extensive integration testing with real TLS handshakes\n- QUIC-specific packet protection\n\nThis represents several weeks of specialized cryptographic engineering work. The issue correctly identifies this as blocking production use of the QUIC module.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: This issue should be:\n1. Re-labeled as 'epic' or 'tracking' issue\n2. Broken down into ~5-10 smaller implementable sub-issues\n3. Each sub-issue tackles one specific function (e.g., 'Implement SocketQUICHandshake_init with SSL_CTX creation')\n4. Assigned to engineers with TLS/QUIC expertise\n\nThe current issue format is correct as a security audit/documentation, but cannot be implemented as a single PR.",
