  "body": "## Summary\nMagic number `2654435761` (Knuth's multiplicative hash constant) is used inline in `hash_sequence()` function without a named constant definition.\n\n## Location\n- **File**: `src/quic/SocketQUICConnectionID-pool.c`\n- **Line**: 80\n- **Function**: `hash_sequence()`\n\n## Issue\n```c\nuint64_t hash = sequence * 2654435761ULL;\n```\n\nWhile documented in a comment, this magic number should be defined as a named constant for:\n- Better code maintainability\n- Reusability across QUIC modules\n- Consistency with other hash constants in `SocketQUICConstants.h`\n\n## Recommendation\nDefine in `include/quic/SocketQUICConstants.h`:\n```c\n/**\n * @brief Knuth's multiplicative hash constant (32-bit).\n * \n * Used for integer hashing in hash tables. This is the 32-bit \n * golden ratio constant: 2^32 / \u03c6 where \u03c6 is the golden ratio.\n */\n#define QUIC_HASH_KNUTH_CONSTANT 2654435761ULL\n```\n\nThen update usage:\n```c\nuint64_t hash = sequence * QUIC_HASH_KNUTH_CONSTANT;\n```\n\n## Category\nRedundancy / Code Quality\n\n## Severity\nHIGH (magic number in hash function)\n\n## Pattern ID\nMAGIC_NUMBER_2654435761",
