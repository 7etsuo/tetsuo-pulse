  "title": "refactor(http2-priority): remove redundant bounds check for urgency value",
  "body": "## Summary\n\nThe bounds check at line 203 in `src/http/SocketHTTP2-priority.c` is redundant - the urgency value is already validated during the parsing loop, making part of this check unreachable.\n\n## Location\n\n**File:** `src/http/SocketHTTP2-priority.c`  \n**Line:** 203\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe code at line 203 checks:\n```c\nif (urgency < 0 || urgency > SOCKETHTTP2_PRIORITY_MAX_URGENCY)\n```\n\nHowever:\n\n1. **`urgency < 0` is dead code:** The variable `urgency` is initialized to `0` at line 165 and only incremented via `urgency = urgency * 10 + (*p - '0')` where `*p` is guaranteed to be `'0'-'9'`. It can never become negative.\n\n2. **`urgency > SOCKETHTTP2_PRIORITY_MAX_URGENCY` is already checked:** The loop at lines 175-195 contains an early bounds check at line 182-187 that returns `-1` if `urgency > SOCKETHTTP2_PRIORITY_MAX_URGENCY`. By the time execution reaches line 203, this condition has already been validated.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nEither:\n- **Remove the redundant check** at line 203 entirely, or\n- **Keep only as defensive programming** with a comment explaining it's intentionally redundant for safety\n\nThe loop already ensures valid bounds:\n```c\n/* Early bounds check to prevent overflow */\nif (urgency > SOCKETHTTP2_PRIORITY_MAX_URGENCY)\n  {\n    SOCKET_LOG_DEBUG_MSG (\"Priority parse error: u=%d out of range [0-7]\", urgency);\n    return -1;\n  }\n```\n\n## Severity\n\n**LOW** - No functional impact, but the dead code adds noise and could confuse future maintainers.\n\n## Category\n\nRedundancy / Dead Code",
