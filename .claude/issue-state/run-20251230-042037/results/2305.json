  "resolution": "Issue was already resolved in commit 8cd2cd2a (PR #2398). The function Socket_simple_dns_request_result at src/simple/SocketSimple-dns.c:715-749 now uses the convert_addrinfo_to_result helper instead of duplicating the conversion logic. The function was reduced from 80 lines to ~35 lines. The related function simple_dns_callback_wrapper was also refactored in the same commit. This change closed issue #2274.",
