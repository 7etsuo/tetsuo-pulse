  "resolution": "Function Socket_simple_dtls_connect_ex was already refactored in PR #2184 (commit fcd7bfef, merged 2025-12-29). The function was broken down from 156 lines to ~119 lines by extracting helper functions: create_and_configure_dtls_client_context() (lines 143-172) and perform_dtls_handshake() (lines 181-192). Current implementation in main branch already follows best practices with focused helper functions.",
