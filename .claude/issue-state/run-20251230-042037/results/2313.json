  "summary": "Refactored Socket_simple_set_keepalive function by extracting platform-specific socket option logic into three focused helper functions (set_keepalive_idle, set_keepalive_interval, set_keepalive_count). Reduced nesting depth from 4 to 2 levels and function length from 65 to ~35 lines, improving readability and maintainability.",
