  "summary": "Refactored SocketTLS_get_peer_cert_info from 63 lines to 29 lines by extracting four helper functions (extract_cert_subject, extract_cert_issuer, extract_cert_serial, extract_cert_fingerprint). Each helper handles a single certificate field extraction. All 44 TLS integration tests passed."
