  "resolution": "Feature already implemented in commit 5b18b7fe (Dec 29, 2025) which closed issue #1402. The SocketTLS_shutdown() function has been refactored with the exact pattern requested: extracted shutdown_handle_result(), shutdown_wait_for_io(), and shutdown_finalize() helpers. Main function reduced from 93 lines to 40 lines, eliminating the deep nesting described in the issue.",
