  "resolution": "The function socket_util_safe_add_u64() that the issue claims is missing already exists in include/core/SocketUtil.h at lines 1847-1854. It was added in commit 9266625f 'refactor(core): add centralized safe arithmetic helpers to SocketUtil.h' and has been in use across the codebase since then. The referenced file src/quic/SocketQUICHandshake.c does not exist in the repository, so there is no code to fix. When QUIC implementation is added in the future, the required helper function will already be available.",
