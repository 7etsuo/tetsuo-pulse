  "summary": "Replaced memset with explicit field initialization to respect volatile qualifier on AsyncIOState structure. Changed lines 250 and 307 from casting away volatile to using explicit field initialization (state.completed=0, state.bytes=0, state.error=0). This prevents potential compiler optimizations that might break threading guarantees."
