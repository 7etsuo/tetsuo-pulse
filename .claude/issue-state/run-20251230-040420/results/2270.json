  "summary": "Refactored socket_async_continue_request by extracting two helper functions: extract_continue_request() for validation and extraction within a single critical section, and resubmit_continuation() for creating and submitting the new request. This simplifies mutex logic from complex 64-line function to 3 focused functions with clear separation of concerns. All 40 async tests pass with sanitizers."
