  "summary": "Replaced assert(event) with explicit NULL check in socketevent_dispatch() to prevent undefined behavior in release builds where NDEBUG is defined. The function now logs an error and returns safely if event is NULL, providing defense against CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) in production environments.",
  "test_results": "test_socketevent: 15/15 tests passed with ASan/UBSan enabled"
