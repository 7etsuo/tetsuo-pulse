  "implementation_notes": "Replaced if-else chain of 6 strcasecmp() calls with dispatch table pattern. Extracted each field handler into separate static function for better maintainability and extensibility. Also implemented missing httpclient_auth_clear_header() function that was declared but not defined. All 45 HTTP client tests pass including digest authentication tests. Tests pass with ASan+UBSan, no memory leaks detected."
