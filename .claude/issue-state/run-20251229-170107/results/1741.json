  "notes": "PR was previously created and closed. Reopened successfully. Documentation added to connection_setup_body_buffer function explaining why it's kept as a single-use function (52 lines, complex allocation logic). One unrelated test failure (test_dns_queue_limit) confirmed to be pre-existing on main branch."
