  "details": "The security bug described in issue #769 was fixed as part of issue #785. The commit replaced the buggy pattern 'offset += SocketQUICVarInt_encode(...); if (offset == 0) return 0;' with the correct 'encode_varint_field' helper function that properly checks return values before updating the offset. All three affected functions (SocketQUIC_send_connection_close, SocketQUIC_send_stream_reset, SocketQUIC_send_stop_sending) have been fixed.",
