  "summary": "Refactored hkdf_expand_label by extracting label building logic into build_hkdf_label helper function. This reduces complexity, improves separation of concerns, and makes the code more testable and maintainable. Also fixed duplicate test definition in test_quic_frame.c that was preventing compilation.",
