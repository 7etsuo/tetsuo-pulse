  "body": "## Issue\nDeep nesting (4 levels) in cookie header recombination with nested loops makes code hard to follow.\n\n**File**: `src/http/SocketHTTP2-stream.c`  \n**Lines**: 1136-1187  \n**Function**: `http2_recombine_cookie_headers`  \n**Pattern**: DEEP_NESTING_4  \n**Severity**: CRITICAL\n\n## Current Code Structure\nThe function has 4 levels of nesting:\n- Outer loop iterating through headers\n- Cookie search loop  \n- Skip check loop\n- Index comparison conditional\n\n## Recommendation\nRefactor to reduce nesting:\n- Extract inner loop logic to separate helper function\n- Use early `continue` statements to reduce nesting\n- Consider using a bitmap or set for tracking indices to skip\n- Reduce maximum nesting to 2 levels\n\n## Benefits\n- Improved readability\n- Clearer loop logic\n- Easier to understand cookie recombination algorithm\n- Better testability of extracted logic",
