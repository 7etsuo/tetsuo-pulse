  "implementation_notes": "Extracted HTTP1_PS_TRAILER_COLON case body into handle_trailer_colon_state() helper function. Reduced nesting depth from 4 to 2 levels. All HTTP1 parser tests pass (34/34). Pre-existing test failures in test_dns_queue_limit and test_http_integration are unrelated to this change."
